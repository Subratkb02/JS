A block is the code found inside a set of curly braces {}. Blocks help us group one or more statements together and serve as an important structural marker for our code.

In global scope, variables are declared outside of blocks. These variables are called global variables. Because global variables are not bound inside a block, they can be accessed by any code in the program, including code in blocks.


Summary:
    Scope refers to where variables can be accessed throughout the program, and is determined by where and how they are declared.

    Blocks are the statements that exist within curly braces {}.

    Global scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.

    Global variables are variables that exist within global scope.

    Block scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible only within the block they are defined.
    Local variables are variables that exist within block scope.

    Global namespace is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.
    
    Scope pollution is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.
