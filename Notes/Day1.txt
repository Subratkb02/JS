Comparison of datatypes :
    >,<,>=,<=,==,!=

    different datatypes Comparison (always ensure the same datatype))
    null>0,null==0,null>=0 ==> false,false,true
    same confusion with undefined datatypes

    === :
        datatype  comparison

Datatypes Summary:
    primitive and non-primitive

    1. Primitive (7 types) :
        1. String
        2. Number
        3. Boolean
        4. Null
        5. Undefined
        6. Symbol
        7. BigInt

    2. Non-primitive (3 types) -Reference type:
        1. Object
        2. Array
        3. Function

Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log().
We can write single-line 

A comment is a piece of text within a program that is not executed but provides additional information to aid in understanding the code.
comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.

There are 8 fundamental 
Data types are used to classify eight fundamental values used for programming in JavaScript, including primitive and object types.
data types in JavaScript: numbers, BigInts, 

Strings are any grouping of characters (letters, spaces, numbers, or symbols) surrounded by quotes or backticks.
strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879

Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'
The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.

Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.

Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().

We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.
Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.
