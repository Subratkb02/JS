Abstraction allows us to write complicated code in a way thatâ€™s easy to reuse, debug, and understand for human readers.

We can work with functions the same way we work with any other type of data, including reassigning them to new variables.

JavaScript functions are first-class objects, so they have properties and methods like any other object.

Functions can be passed into other functions as parameters.

A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both.
This allows for powerful programming patterns like function composition and currying.

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function.

Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument.
