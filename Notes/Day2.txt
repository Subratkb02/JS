Create variables and manipulate the values.
Check what happens when you try concatenating strings using variables of different data types.
Interpolate multiple variables into a string.
Find the data type of a variable’s value using the typeof keyword on a variable.
Use typeof to find the data type of the resulting value when you concatenate variables containing two different data types.

Ternary operator
isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!');

The switch keyword initiates the statement and is followed by ( ... ), which contains the value that each case will compare
The break keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block. Note: Without break keywords, the first matching case will run, but so will every subsequent case regardless of whether or not it matches—including the default.

An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.

if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.

We can add more conditions using else if statements.

Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.

The logical and operator, &&, or “and”, checks if both provided expressions are truthy.

The logical operator ||, or “or”, checks if either provided expression is truthy.

The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.

The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.

A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.
